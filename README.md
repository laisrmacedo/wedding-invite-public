<h3 align="center">WEDDING INVITE</h3>
<h6 align="center">FULL STACK PROJECT</h6>
<br>

## üéØ Motivation

I was asked to create a wedding invitation where the guests would have access to all the necessary information and could confirm their attendance for the couple's big day. Additionally, the organizers should be able to edit the guest list and track those who accepted or declined the invitation.

## üìù Description

This project is a full-stack web application that has already been used in two real weddings and perfectly met the goal of simplifying the organization of the wedding guest list and tracking attendance confirmations. It was entirely conceived and developed by me, from design to coding the frontend and backend. I used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Styled-Components, Axios, and API integration, as well as NodeJS, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL. This repository is a public version with disclosure authorized by the client.


## üì± Interfaces

This project consists of two interfaces:

- **Guest List Organizer Interface:** [laianeeleonardo.vercel.app/novo-convidado/b9iIKbnSmD4M](https://laianeeleonardo.vercel.app/novo-convidado/b9iIKbnSmD4M)

  The organizer begins by registering all the guests for the couple's big day, providing a unique identifier and the number of invitations the guest is entitled to. They can add or remove names as needed. A link is then generated and sent to the respective guest to access the application, and they can only submit their response once. This ensures that no unauthorized person can access the invitation.

</p>

- **Guest Interface:** [laianeeleonardo.vercel.app/nome-do-convidado-3](https://laianeeleonardo.vercel.app/nome-do-convidado-3)

  Each guest receives a specific link that directs them to this interface. Here, the guest has access to all the information about the couple's big day, such as the date and time, the ceremony location, gift instructions, and contact information. Additionally, the guest has the option to accept or decline the invitation, and the organizers can view their response.
